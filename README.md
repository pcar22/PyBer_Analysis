# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type. This was accomplished using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Results
Two CSV data files were combined (city data and ride data csv files). A DataFrame was created, and cleaned in order to perform the analysis.
  - The average fare per ride for an Urban route is 34% lower than the Rural route.
  - The total fares for the Urban route is 897% higher than the Rural route.
  - The total rides for the Ubran route is 171% more than the Rural route.

The multiple line chart shown below, shows that there is an increase in fares towards the end of February and the beginning of March. The chart also shows the difference between the Urban, Suburban and Rural routes in total fares.

## Summary

The Urban route rides generate more revenue however the Rural route is more profitable. 
- I would recommend inproving the profitability of the Urban route.
- I would recommend reducing the number of drivers in the Urban route.
- I would recommend further analysis on the same time period with total rides, to determine if fares should increase during any certain time period.
